# WP-sns
Social networking site made using WordPress


Applications required:
1. xammpp or any other localhosting applications

Steps to open/edit the website:
1. Create a database in your localhosting application. Name it as magdb
2. Download the wordpress.zip file.
3. Extract the file and paste it in your localhosting app folder. (In my case its C:\xampp\htdocs)
4. Open the website using the localhosting application.
5. Go to http://localhost/wordpress/
6. You will be prompt to provide a username and password(uname: admin pass: admin). If you got an error you need to configure your wp-config in the wordpress folder
 
Done! Now you can view and edit the website freely.
